Certainly! Here's a brief explanation of the code:


1. The code begins by importing the necessary libraries: `pandas` for data handling, `nltk` for natural language processing, `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn` for bag-of-words and TF-IDF representations, and `Word2Vec` from `gensim` for word embeddings.


2. The car dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame (`df`) using `pd.read_csv()`.


3. The text data in the DataFrame is preprocessed by tokenizing and cleaning the text. This involves using `nltk`'s `RegexpTokenizer` to tokenize the text into individual words and lowercase them. The tokenization and cleaning process is applied to a new column called `'cleaned_text'`, which concatenates selected columns from the dataset.


4. Bag-of-Words (Count occurrence) representation is performed using `CountVectorizer` from `sklearn`. The `fit_transform()` method is applied to the `'cleaned_text'` column to create a matrix (`count_occurrence`) that represents the count of each word in the text data.


5. Bag-of-Words (Normalized count occurrence) representation is performed using a similar approach as Count occurrence. The matrix (`normalized_count_occurrence`) is then divided by the sum of each row to obtain normalized counts.


6. TF-IDF representation is performed using `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn`. The `fit_transform()` method is applied to the `'cleaned_text'` column to create a matrix (`tfidf_matrix`) that represents the TF-IDF score of each word in the text data.


7. Word2Vec embeddings are created using the `Word2Vec` model from `gensim`. The text data is tokenized into sentences, and the `Word2Vec` model is trained on these sentences to learn word embeddings. The resulting word embeddings are stored in the `word2vec_embeddings` list.


8. Finally, the code prints the results of each representation: Bag-of-Words (Count occurrence), Bag-of-Words (Normalized count occurrence), TF-IDF, and Word2Vec embeddings.


Overall, the code performs various text representation techniques: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec embeddings. These techniques capture different aspects of the text data and can be used for various downstream tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and recommendation systems.


















1. Bag-of-Words (Count occurrence):
   * Counts how often each word appears in a document.
   * Ignores word order and structure.
   * Example: "I love to eat pizza" becomes {"I": 1, "love": 1, "to": 1, "eat": 1, "pizza": 1}.
2. Bag-of-Words (Normalized count occurrence):
   * Considers word frequency relative to the document length.
   * Divides word count by the total number of words in the document.
   * Allows fair comparison across different document lengths.
3. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
   * Measures how important a word is to a document in relation to the entire dataset.
   * Considers both word frequency in a document (TF) and rarity across all documents (IDF).
   * Gives higher weight to words that are frequent in a document but rare overall.
4. Word2Vec embeddings:
   * Learns vector representations of words from large amounts of text.
   * Captures semantic relationships between words.
   * Words are represented as dense vectors in a multi-dimensional space.
   * Helps find similarities and relationships between words.
These techniques convert text into numerical representations for machine learning. They have different strengths and are used based on specific needs.
